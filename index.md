# Welcome to Vittoso's GitHubPage!

Hello everyone!

I am a .NET developer in love with C# working with various technologies (ASP.NET, VSTO, SQL Server among other things).

I work as a Team Leader and Senior developer at [Elfo](http://www.elfo.net) and I'm specialized in developing and supporting software solutions for the Valves & Controls industry.

In my free-time, I usually go to wine tastings (I am a [FISAR](http://www.fisar.org) wine sommelier), play with my Nintendo Switch, love my lovely wife, cope with rheumatoid arthritis and see friends. Busy life!
